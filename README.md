# Simple Analytics Scripts

Simple Analytics is a privacy friendly analytics tool. We just show you the essentials: page views, referrers, top pages, and screen sizes. By default we don't use cookies. We don't collect any personal data. So no cookie banners or GDPR to worry about. When a service is free you are the product. We won't ever sell your data. As a result, we need to charge.

## Open Source

As these public scripts are very important in our mission to privacy we decided to make the source code available. We use the MIT license which is short and to the point. It lets you do almost anything you want with this project, like making and distributing closed source versions. See [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for more info.

All our visitor facing scripts are public and open source. We minify our scripts with [UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/), a well known JavaScript minifier.

### Run this locally

Just run `npm run watch` and every file will be validated and minified on save.
