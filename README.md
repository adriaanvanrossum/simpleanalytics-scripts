# Simple Analytics Scripts

Simple Analytics is a privacy friendly analytics tool with a strong mission: never invade the privacy of your visitors. We just show you the essentials: page views, referrers, top pages, and devices. We don't use cookies. We don't collect any personal data. So no cookie banners or GDPR to worry about. When a service is free you are the product. We won't ever sell your data. As a result, we require a subscription.

## Open Source

As our public scripts are very important in our mission to privacy we decided to make the source code available. We use the MIT license which is short and to the point. It lets you do almost anything you want with this project, like making and distributing closed source versions. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more info.

## Run this locally

Just run `npm run watch` and every file will be validated and minified on save. We minify our scripts with [UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/), a well known JavaScript minifier.

## Device testing is sponsored by BrowserStack

We get amazing sponsoring from [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). Thanks BrowserStack!
