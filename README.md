### Run this locally

To test this I just run a simple python server in this repo:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

I have setup some example domains in my host file:

```
127.0.0.1       example.com
127.0.0.1       simpleanalytics.example.com
```

And I just open http://example.com:8000 in my browser.
