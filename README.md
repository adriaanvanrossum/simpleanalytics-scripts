# Simple Analytics Scripts

Simple Analytics is a privacy friendly analytics tool. We just show you the essentials: page views, referrers, top pages, and screen sizes. By default we don't use cookies. We don't collect any personal data. So no cookie banners or GDPR to worry about. When a service is free you are the product. We won't ever sell your data. As a result, we need to charge.

All our visitor facing scripts are public and open source. We minify our scripts with UglifyJS, a well known JS minifier.

### Run this locally

Just run `npm run watch` and every file will be minified on save.
